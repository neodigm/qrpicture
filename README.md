Welcome to the world of photo realistic QR's.

Features:
*   93x93 pixel QR code capable of holding 100 characters.
*   The size also makes the scanning responsive and fast.
*   186x186 pixel colour information.
*   Colours are chosen from a high-contrast QR-safe palette.
*   Dithering introduces blurring which reduces sharp constrast edges.
*   Repository hosted on [www.qrpicture.com](https://www.qrpicture.com).
    
Creating photo QR's is a two-part process.

First part (`sqcode`) is to create a 93x93 pixel dithered monochrome image overlaid with mandatory QR pixels. 
The applied dithering performs a best match to ensure the CRC is fully compliant. 

The second part (`sqscq`) is to create a 186x186 pixel dithered color image.
The colour palette is created using Spacial Color Quantification.

Both parts use the same SCQ dithering mechanism to maximize shades and perception to give the result a natural effect.
